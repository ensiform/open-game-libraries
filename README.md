__Due to all team members being busy otherwise for some time now, I'm officially putting this project on ice.__

Things to consider
-------------------
* There is still a lot to do before the refactoring is complete, a lot is untested and might not work.
* Linux builds have been left out completely for now, but will be re-added once we're done.
* The binaries needed will not be uploaded onto the git.  Previously they were on google project page.
