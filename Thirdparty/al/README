Source Install
==============

To install OpenAL Soft, use your favorite shell to go into the build/
directory, and run:

cmake ..

Assuming configuration went well, you can then build it, typically using GNU
Make (KDevelop, MSVC, and others are possible depending on your system setup
and CMake configuration).

Please Note: Double check that the appropriate backends were detected. Often,
complaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices can be solved by making
sure the correct backends are being used. CMake's output will identify which
backends were enabled.

For most systems, you will likely want to make sure ALSA, OSS, and PulseAudio
were detected (if your target system uses them). For Windows, make sure
DirectSound was detected.
